A simple 2D fighting game. You can either play 1v1 mode or vs an AI (random moves). To run the game, you need to open the tatakae.exe file in the 'tatakae-executable' folder.

If you want to run the python (code) file, go into the directory 'tatakae' and run the command: 'python src/main.py'. Pytests are ran similarly but with the command: "pytest src/tests/*.py". You need to have python, pygame and unittest.mock installed.
